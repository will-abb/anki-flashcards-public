"PAM 1": "In a PAM configuration file, the {{c1::auth}} keyword specifies the {{c1::authentication}} phase. It checks the user's identity with modules like {{c1::pam_unix.so}} for passwords or {{c1::pam_google_authenticator.so}} for OTPs."
"PAM 2": "The {{c1::account}} keyword in PAM is responsible for {{c1::account management}}, checking if the user's account is valid, has access, and meets the {{c1::account}} policies."
"PAM 3": "The {{c1::session}} keyword in PAM handles setting up and tearing down the user {{c1::session}}, involving tasks like mounting directories and logging session info."
"PAM 4": "The {{c1::password}} keyword in PAM is used for {{c1::password management}}, ensuring that password changes are handled by modules like {{c1::pam_cracklib.so}}, which checks {{c1::password}} strength."
"PAM 5": "PAM modules can be bound with control values, determining how failures are handled. For example, {{c1::[success=1 default=ignore]}} means on success skip the next module, otherwise continue."
"PAM 6": "When a module is marked as {{c1::requisite}}, if it does not succeed, PAM immediately fails without trying the remaining modules, which is useful for critical checks."
"PAM 7": "If a module is marked as {{c1::required}}, PAM tries other modules and only fails after all modules have been attempted, which is useful for necessary but non-critical checks."
"PAM 8": "A module marked as {{c1::sufficient}} will allow PAM to skip the rest of the modules in the stack if it succeeds and no previous modules have failed."
"PAM 9": "Modules marked as {{c1::optional}} are not critical for success, and their result is only used if they are the only module in the stack or affect module stacking with their control values."
"PAM 10": "The {{c1::@include}} directive helps to modularize PAM configurations by including other configuration files, making it easier to manage common authentication requirements."
"PAM 11": "PAM works with {{c1::SELinux}} contexts using modules like {{c1::pam_selinux.so}}, which set the correct security context for the starting session."
"PAM 12": "Using {{c1::pam_limits.so}}, PAM enforces limits on system resources per user, as specified in {{c1::/etc/security/limits.conf}}."
"PAM 13": "The module {{c1::pam_env.so}} is used in PAM to set or unset environment variables for a user session, defined in {{c1::/etc/security/pam_env.conf}} or {{c1::/etc/default/locale}}."
"PAM 14": "The {{c1::pam_gnome_keyring.so}} module automatically starts or stops the GNOME keyring daemon during the user's session."
"PAM 15": "A typical PAM authentication process includes a password check ({{c1::common-auth}}), followed by a YubiKey presence check ({{c1::pam_u2f.so}}), and finally a fallback to Google Authenticator ({{c1::pam_google_authenticator.so}}) if YubiKey is unavailable."
"PAM 16": "{{c1:PAM}} is crucial in a Linux system's security, providing a centralized authentication mechanism that can be tailored for various security policies and requirements."
"PAM 17": "{{c1:PAM}} allows dynamic control of the authentication process through a configuration file for each service, which can include different modules for different types of authentication."
"PAM 18": "Changes in PAM's configuration affect how users authenticate to services like SSH ({{c1::sshd}}), terminals ({{c1::login}}), or administrative privileges ({{c1::sudo}})."
"PAM 19": "PAM's module stacking and control keywords, such as {{c1::requisite}}, {{c1::required}}, {{c1::sufficient}}, and {{c1::optional}}, determine how errors are handled, either by {{c1::failing immediately}}, {{c1::ignoring}}, or requiring successful authentication from subsequent modules."
"PAM 20": "PAM is integrated with various account services, such as c1::password updates}} and {{c1::account expiration}} checks, using modules like pam_pwquality.so and pam_unix.so"
"PAM 21": "There are four types of PAM modules: {{c1::auth}} for authentication, {{c1::account}} for account management, {{c1::session}} for session management, and {{c1::password}} for password management."
"PAM 22": "During the {{c1::session}} management phase, PAM can configure user environments using modules like c1::pam_mkhomedir.so for home directory creation and pam_umask.so for setting file creation masks."
"PAM 23": "PAM controls user access with modules such as {{c1::pam_access.so}}, which checks access control rules, and {{c1::pam_time.so}}, which restricts access based on time."
"PAM 24": "PAM processes authentication requests in a {{c1::predetermined order}}, defined in the service's PAM configuration file, and each module can be set with a {{c1::control flag}} that dictates the flow of authentication."
