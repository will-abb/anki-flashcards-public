"S3 Metadata": "List of text key/value pairs – system or user metadata."
"S3 Tags": "Unicode key/value pair – up to 10, useful for security/lifecycle."
"S3 Version ID": "Version ID if versioning is enabled."
"S3 Security - User-Based": "IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM."
"S3 Security - Resource-Based": "Bucket Policies, Object Access Control List (ACL), Bucket Access Control List (ACL)."
