"EC2 Instance Types - Overview": "EC2 instances can be optimized for different use cases, with a naming convention like m5.2xlarge: 'm' for instance class, '5' for generation, and '2xlarge' for size within the class."
"EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose": "Ideal for diverse workloads such as web servers or code repositories. They offer a balance between compute, memory, and networking. The t2.micro is an example of a General Purpose EC2 instance."
"EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized": "Suitable for compute-intensive tasks that require high-performance processors, like batch processing, media transcoding, and high-performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, machine learning, and dedicated gaming servers."
"EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized": "Provide fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory, such as high-performance relational/non-relational databases, distributed web scale cache stores, in-memory databases optimized for BI, and applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data."
"EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized": "Designed for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage, suitable for OLTP systems, relational & NoSQL databases, cache for in-memory databases (e.g., Redis), data warehousing applications, and distributed file systems."
"Security Groups - Overview": "Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. They can be attached to multiple instances, are specific to a region/VPC, and are enforced outside the EC2 instance, blocking all inbound traffic by default and authorizing all outbound traffic."
"Classic Ports to know": "22 for SSH, 21 for FTP, 22 for SFTP, 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and 3389 for RDP are the classic ports to be aware of for various network services and protocols."
"EC2 Instance Connect - Overview": "Provides a browser-based interface to connect to EC2 instances without needing the key file downloaded initially. It relies on a temporary key uploaded by AWS, primarily compatible with Amazon Linux 2, and requires that port 22 is open."
"EC2 Purchasing Options - Overview": "EC2 offers various purchasing options with different pricing models and commitment levels, including On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Spot Instances, Dedicated Hosts, Dedicated Instances, and Capacity Reservations."
"EC2 On-Demand - Characteristics": "Offers the highest cost flexibility with no upfront payment and no long-term commitment. Billing is per second for Linux or Windows (after the first minute) and per hour for other operating systems, recommended for short-term and uninterrupted workloads."
"EC2 Reserved Instances - Characteristics": "Provide up to a 72% discount compared to On-Demand pricing, with options for 1 or 3-year commitments and various payment options. Instances can be reserved regionally or zonally and are recommended for steady-state usage applications."
"EC2 Savings Plans - Characteristics": "Offer discounts for long-term usage with commitment to a certain type of usage, flexible across instance size, OS, and tenancy within a specific family and region."
"EC2 Spot Instances - Characteristics": "Provide a discount of up to 90% compared to On-Demand, suitable for workloads that are resilient to failure and have flexible start and end times. These instances can be interrupted if the spot price exceeds the bid."
"EC2 Dedicated Hosts - Characteristics": "Are physical servers with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use, allowing you to address compliance requirements and use existing server-bound software licenses, with purchasing options including On-demand and Reserved."
"EC2 Dedicated Instances - Characteristics": "Run on hardware dedicated to you and may share hardware with other instances in the same account, with no control over instance placement."
"EC2 Capacity Reservations - Characteristics": "Allow you to reserve On-Demand instance capacity in a specific AZ for any duration, with no time commitment but charged at On-Demand rates whether you run instances or not."
"EC2 Purchasing Options - Recommendations": "On-Demand is like coming and staying in a resort whenever we like, paying the full price. Reserved is like planning ahead for a long stay to get a discount. Savings Plans is paying a certain amount per hour for a certain period and staying in any room type. Spot Instances are like bidding for empty rooms, where you can get kicked out at any time. Dedicated Hosts are like booking an entire building of the resort. Capacity Reservations are booking a room for a period at full price even if you don’t stay in it."
"EC2 Price Comparison - m4.large - us-east-1": "On-Demand: $0.10 per hour, Spot Instance: $0.038-$0.039 (up to 61% off), Reserved Instance (1 year): $0.062 (No Upfront) - $0.058 (All Upfront), Reserved Instance (3 years): $0.043 (No Upfront) - $0.037 (All Upfront), EC2 Savings Plan (1 year): $0.062 (No Upfront) - $0.058 (All Upfront), Reserved Convertible Instance (1 year): $0.071 (No Upfront) - $0.066 (All Upfront), Dedicated Hosts and Capacity Reservations: On-Demand Price."
