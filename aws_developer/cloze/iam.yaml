"IAM 1": "A {{c1::Credentials Report}} is a document that lists all the account's users and the status of their various credentials. It is account-level."
"IAM 2": "The {{c1::Access Advisor}} feature shows the service permissions granted to a {{c1::user}} and when those services were last accessed, aiding in revising policies."
"IAM 3": "Under the {{c1::Shared Responsibility Model}}, AWS is responsible for the {{c1::infrastructure}} and network security, configuration and vulnerability analysis, and compliance validation."
"IAM 4": "In the {{c1::Shared Responsibility Model}}, the user is responsible for managing and monitoring {{c1::users, groups, roles, policies}}, and using IAM tools for permissions."
"IAM 5": "The {{c1::AWS STS (Security Token Service)}} grants limited and temporary access to AWS resources, including operations like AssumeRole and GetSessionToken."
"IAM 6": "To use {{c1::STS}} to assume a role, define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account and use AWS STS to {{c1::retrieve credentials}} for temporary access."
"IAM 7": "Using {{c1::STS with MFA}}, employ GetSessionToken for MFA-enabled accounts to receive {{c1::temporary}} credentials after additional authentication."
"IAM 8": "A best practice in IAM is to assign specific {{c1::roles}} to AWS services like EC2 and Lambda to ensure the principle of least privilege."
"IAM 9": "In IAM best practices, set up roles for {{c1::cross-account access}} and use AWS STS for assuming these roles with temporary credentials."
"IAM 10": "The Authorization Model in IAM involves an evaluation process where explicit DENY overrides ALLOW, and in the absence of explicit instructions, {{c1::DENY}} is the default."
"IAM 11": "In IAM, {{c1::policies}} are attached to principals, whereas in S3, {{c1::bucket policies}} are attached to buckets, with access evaluated based on the {{c1::intersection}} of both."
"IAM 12": "Employ {{c1::dynamic policies}} in IAM to scale user-specific access, like granting users access to their own S3 'home' folder using dynamic variables."
"IAM 13": "Distinguish between the following types of policies: {{c1::AWS Managed Policies}} or policies maintained by AWS, Customer Managed Policies, which are controlled by the customer, in contrast to {{c1::Inline Policies}} which is the last type."
"IAM 14": "To allow a service to {{c1::assume a role}}, the user must have the iam:PassRole permission, crucial during the setup of many AWS services."
"IAM 15": "In IAM, roles can only be {{c1::assumed}} by services specified in the role's {{c1::trust policy}}, ensuring secure access."
"IAM 16": "Microsoft {{c1::Active Directory (AD)}} is a database of objects in Windows Server, offering centralized security management."
"IAM 17": "AWS Directory Services allows creating an {{c1::AD}} in AWS, managing users, and establishing trust connections with {{c1::on-premise AD}}."
"IAM 18": "The {{c1::AD Connector}} in AWS Directory Services acts as a gateway to on-premise AD, maintaining user management {{c1::on-premise}}."
"IAM 19": "The {{c1::Simple AD}} in AWS Directory Services is a managed directory compatible with AD but cannot join an on-premise AD."
"IAM 20": "AWS {{c1::Identity and Access Management (IAM)}} enables secure management of access to AWS services and resources, including user and group management."
