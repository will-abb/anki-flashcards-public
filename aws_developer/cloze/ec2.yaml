"EC2 1": "{{c1::EC2 instances}} can be optimized for different {{c1::use cases}}, with a naming convention like {{c1::m5.2xlarge}}: '{{c1::m}}' for instance class, '{{c1::5}}' for generation, and '{{c1::2xlarge}}' for size within the class."
"EC2 2": "Ideal for diverse workloads such as {{c1::web servers}} or {{c1::code repositories}}. They offer a balance between {{c1::compute}}, {{c1::memory}}, and {{c1::networking}}. The {{c1::t2.micro}} is an example of a General Purpose EC2 instance."
"EC2 3": "{{c1::Compute Optimized}}: Suitable for compute-intensive tasks that require {{c1::high-performance processors}}, like {{c1::batch processing}}, {{c1::media transcoding}}, and high-performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, {{c1::machine learning}}, and {{c1::dedicated gaming servers}}."
"EC2 4": "{{c1::Memory Optimized}}: Provides fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in {{c1::memory}}, such as high-performance relational/non-relational databases, distributed web scale cache stores, {{c1::in-memory}} databases optimized for BI, and applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data."
"EC2 5": "{{c1::Storage Optimized:}} Designed for {{c1::storage-intensive tasks}} that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on {{c1::local storage}}, suitable for OLTP systems, relational & NoSQL databases, cache for in-memory databases (e.g., {{c1::Redis}}), data warehousing applications, and distributed file systems."
"EC2 6": "Security groups act as {{c1::virtual firewalls}} for EC2 instances, controlling both {{c1::inbound}} and {{c1::outbound traffic}}. They can be attached to multiple instances, are specific to a {{c1::region/VPC}}, and are enforced outside the EC2 instance, {{c1::blocking all inbound traffic}} by default and {{c1::authorizing}} all outbound traffic."
"EC2 7": "{{c1::22}} for SSH, 21 for {{c1::FTP}}, {{c1::22}} for SFTP, 80 for {{c1::HTTP}}, 443 for {{c10::HTTPS}}, and 3389 for {{c12::RDP}} are the classic ports to be aware of for various network services and protocols."
"EC2 8": "{{c1::EC2 Instance Connect}}: Provides a browser-based interface to connect to EC2 instances without needing the key file downloaded initially. It relies on a {{c1::temporary key}} uploaded by AWS, primarily compatible with {{c1::Amazon Linux 2}}, and requires that port {{c1::22}} is open."
"EC2 9": "EC2 offers various purchasing options with different pricing models and commitment levels, including {{c1::On-Demand}} Instances, {{c1::Reserved}} Instances, {{c1::Savings}} Plans, {{c1::Spot}} Instances, {{c1::Dedicated}} Hosts, {{c1::Dedicated}} Instances, and {{c1::Capacity Reservations}}."
"EC2 10": "{{c1::On Demands Instances}}: Offers the highest cost flexibility with no upfront payment and no long-term commitment. Billing is per second for {{c1::Linux}} or {{c1::Windows}} (after the first minute) and per hour for other operating systems, recommended for {{c1::short-term}} and uninterrupted workloads."
"EC2 11": "{{c1::Reserved Instances}}: Provide up to a 72% discount compared to On-Demand pricing, with options for {{c1::1 or 3}}-year commitments and various payment options. Instances can be reserved {{c1::regionally}} or {{c1::zonally}} and are recommended for {{c1::steady-state usage}} applications."
"EC2 12": "{{c1::Savings Plan}}: Offer discounts for long-term usage with commitment to a certain type of usage, flexible across {{c1::instance size}}, {{c1::OS}}, and {{c1::tenancy}} within a specific {{c1::family}} and {{c1::region}}."
"EC2 13": "{{c1::Spot Instances}}: Provide a discount of up to {{c1::90%}} compared to {{c1::On-Demand}}, suitable for workloads that are {{c1::resilient to failure}} and have flexible start and end times. These instances can be interrupted if the {{c1::spot price}} exceeds the bid."
"EC2 14": "Are {{c1::physical servers}} with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use, allowing you to address compliance requirements and use existing server-bound software licenses, with purchasing options including {{c1::On-demand}} and {{c1::Reserved}}."
"EC2 15": "{{c1::Dedicated Instances}}: Run on hardware {{c1::dedicated}} to you and may share hardware with other instances in the same account, with no control over {{c1::instance placement}}."
"EC2 16": "{{c1::Capacity Reservations}}: Allow you to reserve On-Demand instance capacity in a specific {{c1::AZ}} for any duration, with no time commitment but charged at On-Demand rates whether you run instances or not."
"EC2 17": "Amazon EC2's {{c1::Auto Scaling}} feature ensures that you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your {{c1::Amazon EC2}} capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define."
"EC2 18": "With Amazon EC2, you can launch different types of {{c1::instances}} from a single {{c1::AMI}}. An instance type essentially determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance."
