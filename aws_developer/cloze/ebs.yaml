"EBS 1": "An {{c1::EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume}} is a {{c1::network drive}} that can be attached to instances while they {{c1::run}}, allowing for {{c1::data persistence}} beyond instance termination. They are bound to a specific {{c1::Availability Zone}} can be mounted to {{c1::multiple}} instances"
"EBS 2": "{{c1::EBS Volumes}} are network drives that use the {{c1::network}} to communicate with the instance, potentially introducing {{c1::latency}}. They can be quickly {{c1::detached and reattached}} to different EC2 instances within the same {{c1::Availability Zone}}."
"EBS 3": "{{c1::EBS Volumes}} have {{c1::provisioned capacity}}, meaning you choose a size in 2 things: {{c1::GB and IOPS}}, and are billed for all of it. Capacity can be increased over time, and to move a volume across AZs, you must first {{c1::snapshot it}}."
"EBS 4": "{{c1::Delete on Termination}}: This attribute determines whether an EBS volume is deleted when an {{c1::EC2 instance terminates}}. By default, the {{c1::root EBS volume}} is deleted, while additional attached EBS volumes are not."
"EBS 5": "{{c1::Snapshots}} allow for {{c1::point-in-time backups}} of EBS volumes, which can be taken even while the volume is attached (though detaching is recommended). Snapshots can be copied across {{c1::AZs}} or {{c1::Regions}}."
"EBS 6": "Snapshot features include an {{c1::Archive tier}} for cost savings, a {{c1::Recycle Bin}} to recover accidentally deleted snapshots, and {{c1::Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)}} for immediate full performance availability at a higher cost."
"EBS 7": "An {{c1::AMI}} is a customizable template of an EC2 instance that includes {{c1::software}}, {{c1::configurations}}, and the {{c1::operating system}}. AMIs are {{c1::region-specific}} but can be copied across {{c1::regions}}, facilitating faster boot times."
"EBS 8": "{{c1::Instance Store}} provides high-performance {{c1::hardware disks}} for EC2 instances with better {{c1::I/O performance}}. However, data is lost if the instance is {{c1::stopped or terminated}} as it is ephemeral storage, suitable for temporary content."
"EBS 9": "There are six types of EBS Volumes: {{c1::gp2}} and {{c1::gp3}} for general-purpose SSDs; {{c1::io1}} and {{c1::io2}} for high-performance SSDs; {{c1::st1}} and {{c1::sc1}} for HDDs. They differ in performance characteristics and costs, with only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 suitable as boot volumes."
"EBS 10": "General Purpose SSDs like {{c1::gp2}} and {{c1::gp3}} are used for cost-effective, low-latency storage, suitable for boot volumes, virtual desktops, and dev/test environments. Provisioned IOPS SSDs like {{c1::io1}} and {{c1::io2}} are ideal for critical business applications that require sustained IOPS performance, especially databases."
"EBS 11": "Throughput Optimized HDDs ({{c1::st1}}) are for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads, while Cold HDDs ({{c1::sc1}}) are for less frequently accessed data. Both are not suitable as boot volumes."
"EBS 12": "EBS {{c1::Multi-Attach}} allows the same EBS volume to be attached to multiple EC2 instances within the same {{c1::AZ}}, suitable for clustered Linux applications that are cluster-aware."
"EBS 13": "{{c1::EFS}} is a managed NFS that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances across {{c1::AZs}}. It's highly available, scalable, and costlier than EBS, with a {{c1::pay-per-use model}}."
"EBS 14": "EFS offers different {{c1::performance modes}} for various use cases, from general-purpose to {{c1::Max I/O}} for high parallelism. Storage tiers include {{c1::Standard}} and {{c1::Infrequent Access}}, with lifecycle management to move files between tiers."
"EBS 15": "{{c1::EBS volumes}} are for single-instance attachment (except for io1/io2 Multi-Attach) and are {{c1::AZ-specific}}. {{c1::EFS}} is for mounting across multiple instances and AZs, suitable for shared file storage and higher-priced than EBS."
"EBS 16": "{{c1::EBS}} is ideal for single-instance, persistent storage with various performance options. {{c1::EFS}} is suited for shared storage across instances and AZs, offering scalability and high availability at a higher cost."
"EBS 17": "The {{c1::EBS optimized instance}} option allows an EC2 instance to dedicate capacity for EBS I/O without contention or throttling, ensuring consistent performance for both the instance and its attached EBS volumes."
"EBS 18": "When an EBS volume is created from a {{c1::snapshot}}, it begins as a {{c1::lazy-loaded copy}} of the snapshot. Data blocks are loaded on demand from the snapshot, which can initially cause a higher {{c1::latency}}."
"EBS 19": "EBS provides {{c1::encryption at rest}} using AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which uses {{c1::Customer Master Keys}} to encrypt the EBS volumes, protecting data and meeting compliance requirements."
"EBS 20": "EBS {{c1::IOPS}} (Input/Output Operations Per Second) is a metric for the number of read/write operations a volume can handle, crucial for {{c1::database}} and high transaction rate applications."
