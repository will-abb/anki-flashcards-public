"IAM Security Tools - Credentials Report": "A report that lists all the account's users and the status of their various credentials. It is account-level."
"IAM Security Tools - Access Advisor": "Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed. Useful for revising policies."
"Shared Responsibility Model for IAM - Infrastructure": "AWS is responsible for the infrastructure and network security, configuration and vulnerability analysis, and compliance validation."
"Shared Responsibility Model for IAM - User": "The user is responsible for managing and monitoring users, groups, roles, policies, enabling MFA, rotating keys often, using IAM tools for permissions, and analyzing access patterns."
"AWS STS - Security Token Service": "Grants limited and temporary access to AWS resources. It includes AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, GetSessionToken, GetFederationToken, GetCallerIdentity, and DecodeAuthorizationMessage."
"Using STS to Assume a Role": "Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account and use AWS STS to retrieve credentials to impersonate the role for temporary access."
"STS with MFA": "Use GetSessionToken for MFA-enabled accounts to receive temporary credentials after providing additional authentication."
"IAM Best Practices - IAM Roles": "Assign specific roles to EC2 instances, Lambda functions, ECS tasks, and other services to ensure the principle of least privilege."
"IAM Best Practices - Cross Account Access": "Set up IAM roles for cross-account access and use AWS STS for assuming these roles with temporary credentials."
"Advanced IAM - Authorization Model Evaluation of Policies": "The evaluation process for policies: explicit DENY overrides any ALLOW, if no explicit DENY, then ALLOW is granted, otherwise DENY by default."
"IAM Policies & S3 Bucket Policies": "IAM Policies are attached to IAM principals, while S3 Bucket Policies are attached to S3 buckets. Access is evaluated based on both policies."
"Dynamic Policies with IAM": "Use dynamic policies to scale the assignment of user-specific access, for example, using the ${aws:username} variable to grant users access to their own 'home' folder in S3."
"Inline vs Managed Policies": "AWS Managed Policies are maintained by AWS, Customer Managed Policies are created and controlled by the customer, and Inline Policies are directly attached to a single IAM principal."
"Granting a User Permissions to Pass a Role to an AWS Service": "To allow a service to assume a role and perform actions on behalf of the user, the user must have the iam:PassRole permission. This is necessary during the setup of many AWS services."
"Role Trust Policy": "Roles can only be assumed by services that are specified in the role's trust policy."
"Microsoft Active Directory (AD)": "A database of objects like User Accounts and Computers found on Windows Server with AD Domain Services, offering centralized security management."
"AWS Directory Services - Managed Microsoft AD": "Allows creating an AD in AWS, managing users, and establishing trust connections with on-premise AD."
"AWS Directory Services - AD Connector": "Acts as a gateway to redirect to an on-premise AD, with user management maintained on-premise."
"AWS Directory Services - Simple AD": "A managed directory on AWS compatible with AD but cannot be joined with an on-premise AD."
