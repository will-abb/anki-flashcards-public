"Auto Scaling Group (ASG)": "Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match increased load."
"ASG - Scale In": "Remove EC2 instances to match decreased load."
"ASG - Min/Max Capacity": "Ensure we have a minimum and maximum number of EC2 instances running."
"ASG - Load Balancer": "Automatically register new instances to a load balancer."
"ASG - Instance Recreation": "Re-create an EC2 instance if a previous one is terminated."
"ASG - Free": "ASGs are free; you only pay for the underlying EC2 instances."
"ASG Attributes": "Define attributes for ASGs including launch template, size, and scaling policies."
"Launch Template": "AMI + Instance Type, EC2 User Data, EBS Volumes, Security Groups, SSH Key Pair, IAM Roles, Network + Subnets Information, Load Balancer Information."
"ASG - Size": "Min Size, Max Size, Initial Capacity."
"Scaling Policies": "Policies to define how and when to scale instances."
"ASG - CloudWatch Alarms": "Scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms."
"CloudWatch Alarm - Metric": "An alarm monitors a metric such as Average CPU or a custom metric."
"CloudWatch Alarm - Metrics": "Metrics like Average CPU are computed for overall ASG instances."
"CloudWatch Alarm - Scale Out": "Create scale-out policies (increase the number of instances)."
"CloudWatch Alarm - Scale In": "Create scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances)."
"ASG - Scaling Policies": "Dynamic Scaling, Target Tracking Scaling, Simple/Step Scaling, Scheduled Scaling, Predictive Scaling."
"Dynamic Scaling": "Adjust ASG size automatically based on demand."
"Target Tracking Scaling": "Keep ASG metrics like CPU at a target value."
"Simple Scaling": "Scale based on a single CloudWatch alarm trigger."
"Step Scaling": "Scale based on a CloudWatch alarm with steps."
"Scheduled Scaling": "Scale based on a schedule (known usage patterns)."
"Predictive Scaling": "Continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead."
"Good Metrics to Scale On": "CPUUtilization, RequestCountPerTarget, Average Network In/Out, Custom metrics."
"CPUUtilization": "Average CPU utilization across your instances."
"RequestCountPerTarget": "Ensure the number of requests per EC2 instance is stable."
"Average Network In/Out": "Monitor network-bound application metrics."
"Custom Metrics": "Metrics that you push using CloudWatch."
"Scaling Cooldowns": "Cooldown period after scaling activity."
"Cooldown Period": "Default 300 seconds; ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances during this period."
"Cooldown - Advice": "Use a ready-to-use AMI to reduce configuration time and cooldown period."
"Instance Refresh": "Update launch template and recreate all EC2 instances."
"Instance Refresh - Feature": "Native feature of Instance Refresh."
"Instance Refresh - Settings": "Specify minimum healthy percentage and warm-up time."
"Warm-Up Time": "Time until the instance is ready to use."
