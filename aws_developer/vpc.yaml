"VPC - Overview": "Virtual Private Cloud is a private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)."
"VPC - Subnets": "Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)."
"Public Subnet": "A subnet that is accessible from the internet."
"Private Subnet": "A subnet that is not accessible from the internet."
"Route Tables": "Define access to the internet and between subnets."
"Internet Gateway": "Helps VPC instances connect with the internet."
"Internet Gateway - Public Subnets": "Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway."
"NAT Gateway": "Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet while remaining private."
"NAT Instance": "Self-managed alternative to NAT Gateway."
"Network ACL (NACL)": "A firewall that controls traffic to and from a subnet."
"NACL - Rules": "Can have ALLOW and DENY rules."
"NACL - Attachment": "Attached at the Subnet level."
"NACL - Rules Content": "Rules only include IP addresses."
"Security Groups": "A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI or an EC2 Instance."
"Security Groups - Rules": "Can have only ALLOW rules."
"Security Groups - Rules Content": "Rules include IP addresses and other security groups."
"VPC Flow Logs": "Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces."
"Flow Logs - Types": "VPC Flow Logs, Subnet Flow Logs, Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs."
"Flow Logs - Purpose": "Helps to monitor and troubleshoot connectivity issues."
"Flow Logs - Network Information": "Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too."
"Flow Logs - Storage": "Data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose."
"VPC Peering": "Connect two VPCs privately using AWS' network."
"VPC Peering - Behavior": "Make them behave as if they were in the same network."
"VPC Peering - CIDR": "Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)."
"VPC Peering - Transitivity": "Not transitive, must be established for each VPC that need to communicate."
"VPC Endpoints": "Connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public internet."
"VPC Endpoints - Security": "Enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services."
"VPC Endpoint Gateway": "For S3 & DynamoDB."
"VPC Endpoint Interface": "For other services."
"VPC Endpoints - Scope": "Only used within your VPC."
"Site to Site VPN": "Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS."
"Site to Site VPN - Encryption": "Connection is automatically encrypted."
"Site to Site VPN - Network": "Goes over the public internet."
"Direct Connect (DX)": "Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS."
"Direct Connect - Network": "Private, secure, and fast connection."
"Direct Connect - Setup Time": "Takes at least a month to establish."
"VPC Summary": "Overview of key VPC components."
"VPC": "Virtual Private Cloud."
"Subnets": "Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC."
"Internet Gateway": "At the VPC level, provide Internet Access."
"NAT Gateway / Instances": "Give internet access to private subnets."
"NACL": "Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound."
"Security Groups": "Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI."
"VPC Peering": "Connect two VPCs with non-overlapping IP ranges, non-transitive."
"VPC Endpoints": "Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC."
"VPC Flow Logs": "Network traffic logs."
"Site to Site VPN": "VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS."
"Direct Connect": "Direct private connection to AWS."
"Typical 3-Tier Solution Architecture": "Common architecture pattern."
"Multi AZ": "Availability across multiple Availability Zones."
"Auto Scaling Group": "Automatically scale EC2 instances based on demand."
"ElastiCache": "Store/retrieve session data and cached data."
"Public Subnets": "Subnets accessible from the internet."
"Private Subnets": "Subnets not accessible from the internet."
"Data Subnet": "Subnet for database services."
