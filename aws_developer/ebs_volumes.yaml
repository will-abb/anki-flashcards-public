"EBS Volume - Definition": "An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive that can be attached to instances while they run, allowing for data persistence beyond instance termination. They are bound to a specific Availability Zone and can only be mounted to one instance at a time, at the CCP level."
"EBS Volume - Characteristics": "EBS Volumes are network drives that use the network to communicate with the instance, potentially introducing latency. They can be quickly detached and reattached to different EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone."
"EBS Volume - Capacity": "EBS Volumes have provisioned capacity, meaning you choose a size in GB and IOPS, and are billed for all of it. Capacity can be increased over time, and to move a volume across AZs, you must first snapshot it."
"EBS - Delete on Termination": "This attribute determines whether an EBS volume is deleted when an EC2 instance terminates. By default, the root EBS volume is deleted, while additional attached EBS volumes are not."
"EBS Snapshots": "Snapshots allow for point-in-time backups of EBS volumes, which can be taken even while the volume is attached (though detaching is recommended). Snapshots can be copied across AZs or Regions."
"EBS Snapshots - Features": "Snapshot features include an Archive tier for cost savings, a Recycle Bin to recover accidentally deleted snapshots, and Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) for immediate full performance availability at a higher cost."
"AMI - Amazon Machine Image": "An AMI is a customizable template of an EC2 instance that includes software, configurations, and the operating system. AMIs are region-specific but can be copied across regions, facilitating faster boot times."
"EC2 Instance Store": "Instance Store provides high-performance hardware disks for EC2 instances with better I/O performance. However, data is lost if the instance is stopped as it is ephemeral storage, suitable for temporary content."
"EBS Volume Types": "There are six types of EBS Volumes: gp2 and gp3 for general-purpose SSDs; io1 and io2 for high-performance SSDs; st1 and sc1 for HDDs. They differ in performance characteristics and costs, with only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 suitable as boot volumes."
"EBS Volume Types - Use Cases": "General Purpose SSDs like gp2 and gp3 are used for cost-effective, low-latency storage, suitable for boot volumes, virtual desktops, and dev/test environments. Provisioned IOPS SSDs like io1 and io2 are ideal for critical business applications that require sustained IOPS performance, especially databases."
"EBS Volume Types - HDD Use Cases": "Throughput Optimized HDDs (st1) are for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads, while Cold HDDs (sc1) are for less frequently accessed data. Both are not suitable as boot volumes."
"EBS Multi-Attach - io1/io2": "EBS Multi-Attach allows the same EBS volume to be attached to multiple EC2 instances within the same AZ, suitable for clustered Linux applications that are cluster-aware."
"EFS - Elastic File System": "EFS is a managed NFS that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances across AZs. It's highly available, scalable, and costlier than EBS, with a pay-per-use model."
"EFS - Performance & Storage Classes": "EFS offers different performance modes for various use cases, from general-purpose to Max I/O for high parallelism. Storage tiers include Standard and Infrequent Access, with lifecycle management to move files between tiers."
"EFS vs EBS": "EBS volumes are for single-instance attachment (except for io1/io2 Multi-Attach) and are AZ-specific. EFS is for mounting across multiple instances and AZs, suitable for shared file storage and higher-priced than EBS."
"EC2 Volumes Summary": "EBS is ideal for single-instance, persistent storage with various performance options. EFS is suited for shared storage across instances and AZs, offering scalability and high availability at a higher cost."
