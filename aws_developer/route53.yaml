"Route 53 - Routing Policies": "Define how Route 53 responds to DNS queries."
"Routing Policies - Simple": "Route traffic to a single resource, can specify multiple values in the same record, if multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client, can’t be associated with Health Checks."
"Routing Policies - Weighted": "Control the % of requests that go to each specific resource, can be associated with Health Checks, assign a weight of 0 to stop sending traffic to a resource."
"Routing Policies - Latency-based": "Redirect to the resource with the least latency close to users, based on traffic between users and AWS Regions, can be associated with Health Checks (failover capability)."
"Route 53 - Health Checks": "HTTP Health Checks are only for public resources."
"Health Checks - Automated DNS Failover": "Monitor an endpoint, other health checks, or CloudWatch Alarms."
"Health Checks - CloudWatch Alarms": "Full control - monitor throttles of DynamoDB, alarms on RDS, custom metrics."
"Health Checks - Integration": "Health Checks are integrated with CloudWatch metrics."
"Health Checks - Endpoint Monitoring": "About 15 global health checkers check the endpoint health."
"Endpoint Monitoring - Threshold": "Healthy/Unhealthy Threshold is 3 (default)."
"Endpoint Monitoring - Interval": "30 sec (can set to 10 sec, higher cost)."
"Endpoint Monitoring - Protocols": "Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP."

"Endpoint Monitoring - Response Text": "Pass/fail based on the text in the first 5120 bytes of the response."
"Endpoint Monitoring - Router/Firewall": "Configure to allow incoming requests from Route 53 Health Checkers."
"Calculated Health Checks": "Combine results of multiple health checks into a single health check."
"Calculated Health Checks - Logic": "Use OR, AND, or NOT logic."
"Calculated Health Checks - Child Checks": "Monitor up to 256 child health checks."
"Calculated Health Checks - Maintenance": "Perform maintenance without causing all health checks to fail."
"Private Hosted Zones - Health Checks": "Route 53 health checkers can't access private endpoints."
"Private Hosted Zones - CloudWatch": "Create a CloudWatch Metric, associate a CloudWatch Alarm, create a Health Check that checks the alarm."
"Routing Policies - Failover": "Active-Passive routing."
"Failover - Health Check": "Health check is mandatory for failover."
"Routing Policies - Geolocation": "Route traffic based on user location."
"Geolocation - Location": "Specify location by Continent, Country, or US State."
"Geolocation - Default": "Create a 'Default' record in case there's no match on location."
"Geolocation - Use Cases": "Website localization, restrict content distribution, load balancing."
"Routing Policies - Geoproximity": "Route traffic based on geographic location of users and resources."
"Geoproximity - Traffic Shift": "Shift more traffic to resources based on defined bias."

"Domain Registrar vs. DNS Service": "Buy or register your domain name with a Domain Registrar."
"DNS Service": "Domain Registrar usually provides a DNS service, but you can use another DNS service."
